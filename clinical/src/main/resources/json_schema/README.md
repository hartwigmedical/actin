*** Provided Clinical Data JSON Schema

Contained in this folder is a JSON schema that describes the structure of the clinical data that is expected to be provided to the system. 

To regenerate the schema after a change to any classes in `src/main/kotlin/com/hartwig/actin/clinical/feed/standard/ProvidedDataFeedDatamodel.kt`,
run `ProvidedClinicalSchemaWriterKt` from IntelliJ. It requires no arguments, so just right click and run. 

When complete, format and commit the schema stored in this directory.
