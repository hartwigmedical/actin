## ACTIN-Clinical

ACTIN-Clinical ingests (external) clinical feed and uses an internal curation database to create data in terms of the datamodel described
below. This clinical model is written to a per-patient json file. The clinical data can be loaded into a mysql database
via [ACTIN-Database](../database/README.md).

This application requires Java 11+ and can be run as follows:

```
java -cp actin.jar com.hartwig.actin.clinical.ClinicalIngestionApplicationKt \
   -feed_directory /path/to/feed_file_dir \
   -curation_directory /path/to/curation_file_dir \
   -doid_json /path/to/full_doid_tree_json_file \
   -output_directory /path/to/where/clinical_json_files/are/written
```

### Disease Ontology ID

For mapping of primary tumor location and type, second primaries and 'other conditions' in the ACTIN clinical datamodel,
one or more Disease Ontology IDs (DOIDs) are assigned. For more information, see https://disease-ontology.org/.

## Clinical Datamodel

Every patient, uniquely defined by their patient ID, has a clinical record with the following data:
