## ACTIN-Report

ACTIN-Report generates a PDF based on all data fed into ACTIN and generated by [ACTIN-Algo](../algo/README.md).
An example PDF can be found [here](src/main/resources/example.actin.pdf)

This application requires Java 17+ and can be run as follows:

```
java -cp actin.jar com.hartwig.actin.report.ReporterApplication \
   -patient_json /path/to/patient_record.json \
   -treatment_match_json /path/to/treatment_match.json \
   -output_directory /path/where/pdf/is/written \
```

The following assumptions are made about the inputs:

- The patient record JSON adheres to datamodel defined in [PatientRecord](../datamodel/src/main/kotlin/com/hartwig/actin/datamodel/PatientRecord.kt)
- The treatment match JSON is the output generated by [ACTIN-Algo](../algo/README.md)

### Report Configuration
A report configuration can be provided via the `-override_yaml` parameter, specifying what parts of the report should be generated.

Additionally, the flag `-enable_extended_mode` can be set to set every report configuration option to its most comprehensive value.
