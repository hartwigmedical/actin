## ACTIN-Algo

ACTIN-Algo matches a patient record (clinical & molecular data) with available treatments.

This application requires Java 11+ and can be run as follows:

```
java -cp actin.jar com.hartwig.actin.algo.TreatmentMatcherApplicationKt \
   -clinical_json /path/to/clinical.json \
   -molecular_json /path/to/molecular.json \
   -treatment_database_directory /path/to/potential_treatment_options \
   -doid_json /path/to/full_doid_tree_json_file \
   -output_directory /path/where/output/is/written \
```

The following assumptions are made about the inputs:

- The clinical JSON adheres to the datamodel defined by [ACTIN-Clinical](../clinical/README.md)
- The molecular JSON adheres to the datamodel defined by [ACTIN-Molecular](../molecular/README.md)
- The treatment database directory is the output directory of [ACTIN-Treatment](../treatment/README.md)

An optional flag `run_historically` can be added in which case the treatment matcher sets the date to 3 weeks after the
patient's registration date. If this flag is not set, the treatment matcher uses the current date as reference date.

### Treatment matching

Every treatment defined in the treatment database is evaluated independently.

In case a treatment is a trial, all relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria are evaluated for this trial as well as every criterion
for any specific cohort within this trial.

Every criterion evaluates to one of the following options:

| Evaluation      | Description                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PASS            | The patient complies with the inclusion or exclusion criterion.                                                                          |
| WARN            | The patient may or may not comply with inclusion or exclusion criterion. A manual evaluation is required.                                |
| FAIL            | The patient does not comply with the inclusion or exclusion criterion.                                                                   |
| UNDETERMINED    | The data that is required to evaluate the inclusion or exclusion criterion is unavailable.                                               |
| NOT_EVALUATED   | The evaluation of the inclusion or exclusion criterion is skipped and can be assumed to be irrelevant for determining trial eligibility. |
| NOT_IMPLEMENTED | No algo has been implemented yet for this criterion.                                                                                     |

#### Recoverable status

Each criterion algorithm is configured as 'recoverable' or 'unrecoverable', indicating whether the outcome of the criterion evaluation
could potentially be recovered in case of a `FAIL`. For example, lab values may be insufficient at the moment of evaluation, leading
to `FAIL`, but may be sufficient 2 weeks later
when a new lab test has been done. Hence, lab rules can be 'recoverable', whereas a primary tumor location cannot change and primary tumor
location rules are thus 'unrecoverable'.

#### Evaluation feedback

Every criterion algorithm provides human-readable feedback ('messages') about its evaluation, so that a human can easily and quickly
understand which
evaluation has been done and why the outcome of the evaluation (`PASS`,`WARN`, `FAIL`, `UNDETERMINED` or `NOT_EVALUATED`) is as it is.

#### Treatment eligibility

Once all criteria are evaluated, the following algorithm determines whether a patient is potentially eligible for a trial:

1. For every cohort within a trial, the patient is considered potentially eligible for that cohort in case none of the cohort-specific
   criteria evaluated to unrecoverable `FAIL` or `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
2. A patient is eligible for a trial in case none of its overall criteria evaluated to unrecoverable `FAIL` or `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` and the
   trial
   either has no cohorts defined or has at least one cohort that is considered potentially eligible.

Note that, following this logic, a patient is only considered potentially eligible for a cohort if both the cohort is considered eligible
_and_ the trial that the cohort is part of is considered eligible.

#### Criterion algorithms

Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be defined as a set of rules that are combined using composite functions, to determine overall
eligibility.

The following composite functions are available:

| Function | Description                                                                     |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AND      | indicates that all combined rules should PASS in order to PASS                  |
| OR       | indicates that one of the combined rules should PASS in order to PASS           |
| NOT      | indicates that the rule should resolve to FAIL in order to PASS                 |
| WARN_IF  | indicates that the rule should resolve to WARN in case evaluation leads to PASS |

Some rules require 1 ("X") or more ("X" and "Y") additional configuration parameter(s) that can be set to match the requirements of each
trial.
Also, note that some inclusion and exclusion criteria can be mapped to rules that are currently explicitly set to PASS or explicitly
won't be evaluated.

The following rules are available:

##### Rules related to general characteristics / statements

1] 'Category' can be one of: Chemotherapy, Hormone therapy, Immunotherapy, Targeted therapy, Radiotherapy, Surgery, Transplantation, Trial,
Antiviral therapy, Vaccine, Car T, TCR T, Gene therapy, Supportive treatment.

In addition, the following 'Categories' can be assigned:

- Taxane - Treatment names: Paclitaxel, Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel
- Fluoropyrimidine - Treatment names: Capecitabine, Carmofur, Doxifluridine, Fluorouracil, Tegafur
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors - Category = 'Targeted therapy' and (T.B.D.)
- Nonsteroidal anti-androgen - Treatment names: Flutamide, Nilutamide, Bicalutamide, Enzalutamide, Darolutamide, Ketodarolutamide,
  Apalutamide
- Novel hormone therapy for prostate - Treatment names: Abiraterone, Apalutamide, Darolutamide, Enzalutamide

Notes:

- For category Taxane & Fluoropyrimidine, in case only 'Chemotherapy' is configured for a treatment (without further details), resolve
  to `UNDETERMINED`
- For category Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, in case only 'Targeted therapy' is configured for a treatment (without further details), resolve
  to `UNDETERMINED`
- For category Nonsteroidal anti-androgen, in case only 'Hormone therapy' is configured for a treatment (without further details), resolve
  to `UNDETERMINED`

2] 'Category' with specified 'type' can be only one of: Chemotherapy, Hormone therapy, Immunotherapy, Targeted therapy, Radiotherapy,
Transplantation, Trial, Car T, Supportive treatment ; since these have a corresponding type in treatment model. For type, multiple types can
be specified within one rule, separated by ";"

Note that if the type of the requested category is not configured for a treatment, evaluation resolves to `UNDETERMINED`

Finally, any trial that a patient has participated in counts as one potential treatment of any type or category.
Trials could lead to `WARN` in case knowing the exact trial treatment is required to do a conclusive evaluation.

ULN = Upper Limit of Normal, LLN = Lower Limit of Normal; implemented as refLimitUp and refLimitLow, respectively.

Notes:

- For all lab values, the most recent available lab value (up to 90 days old) is evaluated.
- If the most recent lab value is within the requested range but more than 30 days old, the evaluation resolves to `WARN` instead of `PASS`
- If the most recent lab value is out of the requested range, the second-last lab value is evaluated.
    - In case that a second-last lab value is available, less than 90 days old and within requested range, the evaluation resolves to `WARN`
      .
    - In case there is no applicable second-last value, or this value is also out of requested range, the evaluation resolves to `FAIL`.

  only noted in questionnaire when grade => 2.
  In case X = 3 or 4, the evaluation resolves to `UNDETERMINED` if there are names for which grade is not specified.
- For all EHR toxicities, ignore the toxicity if the name of the toxicity is also indicated as a complication
- For all EHR toxicities, only the most recent toxicity examination per toxicity is considered for evaluation.
- In case toxicity evaluation resolves to `PASS` without support of at least one questionnaire toxicity, the evaluation resolves to `WARN`
  instead.

For SBP, DBP and Pulse oximetry, evaluation should resolve to `UNDETERMINED` rather than `FAIL` in case of no PASS, but at least 1 of the up
