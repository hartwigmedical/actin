Run the following commands as root (admin) on mysql prior to building

NOTE: Below is tested on mysql servers 5.7.21 and 8.0.18

mysql> CREATE USER 'build'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'build';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE actin_test;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL on actin_test.* TO 'build'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

Maven automatically rebuilds the actin_test database based on DDL statements provided
in file generate_database.sql via this additional Maven build step we are automatically
sure the jOOQ generated Java entity code always matches the DDL statements.

MySQL database setup is triggered via setup_database.sh script that is assuming MySQL
login credentials to be provided via actin.login located in your home directory.

Create actin.login file:

cat ~/actin.login << HERE
[client]
database=actin_test
user=build
password=build
HERE

For MySQL to accept the login file, make sure that the login file is only readable by you:

chmod 600 ~/actin.login

From now on any change made to the database definition in generate_database.sql is
automatically taken into account by the generated Java code.
